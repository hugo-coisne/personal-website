# personal-website

I intend to take inspiration from Joe Rogan's website.
That said, I will of course keep getting inspiration from multiple existing websites that can be found online.

I haven't studied any JS framework yet, so this is a first "old-school" version that will inevitably be redone using modern development techniques.

Here's the structure that I will lay out first :

- welcome page

  - short intro

    - based in Lille, France
    - engineering student
    - autodidact
    - web designer (someday)
    - tutor
    - calisthenics amateur

  - picture of me
    - look for someone who could take some good pictures in exchange of credit on the website

- websites portfolio and testimonials

- about

  - detailed bio

  - trips and unusual experiences

  - goals
    - become a self-employed fullstack web developer (and engineer)
    - become a polyglot
    - create apps and webapps that help people in their everyday lives
    - create a better school system for future generations

- contact

  - email
  - linkedin
